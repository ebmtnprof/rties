\title{Estimates first and second derivatives of an oberved state variable}
\usage{
estDerivs(basedata, taus, embeds, delta, sysVarInclude = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{basedata}{A dataframe that was produced with the "dataPrep" function.}

\item{taus}{A vector containing the values of tau to use. Tau indicates the number of time points to lag in the lagged data matrix (see Boker, S.M., Deboeck, P.R., Edler, C., & Keel, P.K. (2010). Generalized local linear approximation of derivatives from time series. In S.M. Chow & E. Ferrer (Eds.), Statistical Methods for Modeling Human Dynamics: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue (pp. 161-178). New York, NY: Taylor & Francis Group). The first derivative is estimated as the mean of the two adjacent slopes across that number of lags, e.g., if tau = 2 then the estimate of the first derivative at time = t is based on the mean of the slopes left and right of time t across 2 observations each. The second derivative is the difference in the two slopes with respect to time. Tau = 1 is sensitive to noise and increasing its value acts as smoothing.}

\item{embeds}{A vector containing the values of embeds to use. Embeds indicates the number of columns in the lagged data matrix. The minimum = 3 for 2nd order derivatives and higher values increase smoothing.}

\item{delta}{A value indicating the inter-observation interval. For example, if delta = 2, then every second observation is used in the estimation process.}

\item{sysVarInclude}{An optional argument specifying whether the system variable was included in the dataframe during the dataPrep step (TRUE), or not (FALSE). Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list including: 1) "data" which is a dataframe containing first and second derivative estimates of an observed state variable, and 2) "fitTable" which shows the maximal R^2 achieved for each dyad for a coupled oscillator model, along with the associated tau, embed and estimated period of oscillation.
}
\description{
This function makes use of 2 functions written by Steven Boker, "gllaWMatrix" and "gllaEmbed" which are available on his website, http://people.virginia.edu/~smb3u/. It fits a coupled oscillator model for each dyad at different combinations of the input parameters (tau, embeds) and returns the input values and period of oscillation that maximize the R^2 for each dyad. It also estimates first and second derivatives of the observed state variable for each person at the input values that maximize the R^2 for that dyad and returns a dataframe that contains them.
