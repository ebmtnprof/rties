\title{Compares model fit for the uncoupled and coupled oscillator for each dyad's state trajectories using an R-square comparison.}
\usage{
indivCloCompare(derivData)
}
\arguments{
\item{derivData}{A dataframe that was produced with the "estDerivs" function.}
}
\value{
The function returns a named list including: 1) the adjusted R^2 for the uncoupled model for each dyad (called "R2uncouple"), 2) the adjusted R^2 for the coupled model for each dyad (called "R2couple"), and 3) the difference between the R-squares for each dyad (coupled - uncoupled, called "R2dif").
}
\description{
Fits an uncoupled and coupled oscillator model to each dyad's observed state variables and returns the adjusted R-squares, along with the difference between them (coupled - uncoupled, so positive values indicate better fit for the more complex model).
